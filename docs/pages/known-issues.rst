.NET Driver
===========

Calling ``GetPNGScreenshot`` throws ``StackOverflow`` error
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Problem**: For high resolutions calling ``GetPNGScreenshot`` might throw a
``StackOverflow`` error.

**Workaround**: The issue only happens with .NET 6 as a workaround you can use
.NET 5, or if you can't downgrade to .NET 5, try to run your tests with a lower
resolution until this issue is fixed.

**Affects**: AltUnityTester v1.7.0 with .NET 6
