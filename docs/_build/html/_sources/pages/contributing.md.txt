# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AltUnityTester.

## Did you find a bug? 

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching all issues.  
If you’re unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a [new issue](https://gitlab.com/altom/altunity/altunitytester/issues/new?issuable_template=BugTemplate)

#### When you ask a question about a problem you will get a much better/quicker answer if you provide a code sample that can be used to reproduce the problem. Try to:

* Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem.
* Provide all parts needed to reproduce the problem (code and model if needed).
* Test the code you’re about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem.
